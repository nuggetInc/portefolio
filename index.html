                <p>Hi, I'm Cas. I'm a jr. developer about 3 years ago I got interested in programming and I've been
                    doing it ever since.</p>

                <p>In mid 2020 I went to study software development, but by this time I already was far in front of
                    other students.</p>

                <p>I build games, tools for games, sites and things to help with school, but out of all of them I enjoy
                    game development the most.</p>

                        <p>3 years ago when I first started programming C# was the first language I started with.</p>
                        <p>The year prior I had been watching videos about C# and unity so naturally I chose to learn
                            C#, this didn't last long due to me being inexperienced and C# being an advanced language.
                        </p>
                        <p>The biggest fail, I made back then was to only learn and not practice with C#</p>
                        <p>2 years later I got back into C# this time more experienced. I quickly became good with it,
                            but am still learning</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A few months ago I started learning Java, I was getting a bit irritated by the style of
                            coding with Unity so I wanted to switch to another engine that was a bit more code based
                            instead of the visual style of Unity.</p>
                        <p>This is where I landed on LibGDX in Java I had heard about Java from games like Minecraft,
                            but I didn't know much about it, luckily it was easy enough to get into since I was already
                            used to typed languages due to C#.</p>
                        <p>I've been having a much better time with LibGDX than with Unity because I prefer the freedom
                            it gives compared to Unity.</p>

                        <div class="icon-wrapper"><img src="images/icons/Html.png" alt="Java logo"></div>
                        <h2>HTML</h2>
                    </header>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>After I found out that C# was too high of a grip for me, I moved to HTML so I could learn a
                            more simple language first before I would tackle the harder ones like C#.</p>
                        <p>This time I made sure to use the language while learning it which greatly helped.</p>
                        <p>I didn't go that advanced with HTML back then, because at a certain point you can only learn
                            it by making sites and since I had no need for them it's hard to come up with one.</p>
                        <p>I later shaved off most of the rough edges at the software development classes and with the
                            knowledge I learned from that I was able to make this portfolio.</p>

                    </header>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>After HTML the thing to learn was obviously CSS since that would greatly boost the looks of
                            my sites and would also give me extra experience with HTML.</p>
                        <p>Like with HTML at a certain point I couldn't think of anymore things I could make for
                            learning so the use of this language came to a standstill.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of my software development classes CSS was a weak point, I wasn't good with
                            it, nor did I know much about it, this quickly changed due to the amount of sites we had to
                            make for classes.</p>
                        <p>Both the HTML and CSS of this site are completely written by me with the knowledge I gained
                            ofter the last years.</p>

                        <p>Javascript was a bit all over the place I knew the basis of it, but due to it having no use
                            for me I didn't learn much.</p>
                        <p>In mid 2020 I started using it more since I started needing it more and more.</p>
                        <p>This portfolio currently doesn't include any Javascript due to there being no use that I
                            could think of.</p>
                        <p>I've greatly advanced with my Javascript knowledge and recently started learning a superset
                            of Javascript called "Typescript".</p>

                        <p>This is where my game development carreer really started. 3 years ago after learning the
                            basics of C#, HTML and CSS I found an app that would let me program on the iPad (I had no
                            laptop back then) in a game development environment with Lua.</p>
                        <p>I quickly got hooked into it due to Lua being a basic language and the ability to be able to
                            think of game projects that I could work on and learn from.</p>
                        <p>After 2 years of developing in Lua I was happy to move on to C# with my knowledge of
                            programming and my first laptop.</p>

                        <p>A thing that's always fun to do with game development, is create game design with designing
